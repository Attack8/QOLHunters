Adds several quality-of-life features to Vault Hunters, aiming to remain within the spirit of the game but improving the player experience.

- Download from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/qol-hunters) and drop into your mods folder
- Most features can be toggled on/off using the in-game configuration menu accessible with `Alt+Q`

**Compatibility**

- VH 3.15.1.4
- ?Wold's Vaults 0.11.3a (for some reason it doesn't fully work)
