Bakes text overlays onto the  Modifier icons to make it easier to identify which modifiers are active inside a vault. 

**Installation**

Drop into your mods folder
If updating from a previous version, make sure you delete  configs/the_vault/vault_modifiers_iridium.json

**Compatibility**

VH 3.15.1.4
?Wold's Vaults 0.11.3a (for some reason it doesn't fully work)

**Interpretation**

White text = standard positive modifiers
Orange text = negative modifiers
Green text = special positive modifiers



Planned Features
I plan to expand this mod with additional features across the rest of the UI, not just the vault modifiers icons. The biggest thing I want to do is update the abilities page to include more details as well as overlevel information
